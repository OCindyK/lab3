/*
The object below represents a single city.
a) Write a function that takes an object as an argument and uses a forâ€¦in loop to access 
and print to the console each of those object properties and their values. Test it using 
the sydney object below.
b) Create a new object for a different city with different properties and call your function 
again with the new object.
